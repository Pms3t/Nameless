# Nameless
Unity project created during my first year of university for game development technologies course. 

This repository contains two folders. One for game engine files and other for playable game files.
Playable version doesn't require installation of Unity game engine.

This project was meant for game development technologies course where students were required to 
create one independent project. Project itself isn't by any means in perfect condition, but I'm 
proud what I was able to create even if I had trouble figuring out what I wanted to create.
I learned a lot from this project. When I start my next game project I'm sure it turns out 
better thanks to this experience.
